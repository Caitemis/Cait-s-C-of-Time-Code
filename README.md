# Cait' C of Time Code

This is a repository for all my C of Time stuff for PMD: Explorers of Sky hacks. Files are separated by project. To use them yourself, you need to set up C of Time!

C of Time can be found here: https://github.com/SkyTemple/c-of-time/tree/main

Big thanks to Adex, HeckaBad, HappyLappy, Chesyon, Sudzoof, and Frostbyte for helping out and making contributions and fixes! Anything that's entirely their work is noted in the comments.
